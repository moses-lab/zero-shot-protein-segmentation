# zero-shot-protein-segmentation



How to perform protein segmentation using Colab:

1. Open https://colab.research.google.com/ in a new tab or window. You may need to log in to your google account.
2. From the "open notebook" menu select "GitHub".
3. Enter github URL: "moses-lab/zero-shot-protein-segmentation/".
4. Click on the notebook "/zero-shot-protein-segmentation/zero_shot_protein_segmentation_colab.ipynb".
5. Run blocks of code by clicking on the top left hand corner "play" button. You do not have to run the blocks of code that save the results (some of these generate large data files)
6. To download saved results from colab to your computer. Click on the file folder icon on the left and you should be able to see your file(s). Click on the 3 vertical dots directly to the right of the file name and select "Download". If the file does not appear immediately, click on the refresh button in the file folder sub menu (just below the "Files"). Files generated in this colab session might be deleted from colab when the window is closed.
